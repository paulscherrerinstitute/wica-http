# Wica-HTTP Docker Secure RUN Profile
# ===================================

# Note: this profile is used when WICA is running inside a docker container and exposing
#       its services in secure (https) mode on port 443.

# Spring Boot Framework Configuration
# -----------------------------------

# The host the service will run on. This is the address that the Spring Boot internal
# Tomcat server will bind to. This is the Docker bridge IP.
# note: the address will increment by 1 for each configured service in the
# container.

# Note: the cipher list was extended because initial attempts were found to be incompatible

# The implementation is unable to determine the health status of the filesystem when the container host

# Additional Notes on CORS configuration:
#
# The definitions below control how the Wica-HTTP Server enters into so-called "CORS negotiation"
# with web browser clients to determine the browser's behaviour when a script loaded from website A
# attempts to make an HTTP request on a different website B.
#
# Note: this topic is of direct relevance to Wica webpage developers who may want to edit and
# load webpages from the local filesystem which subsequently make requests on the Wica-HTTP
# server.
#
# The default settings defined below do not impose any restrictions on the server-side. But note,
# the developer's web browsers may need their security settings configured (= reduced) to allow
# for cross-site working.  See the Mozilla developers notes for further information on CORS.
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
#
# Please google "Disable CORS in browser" to find the appropriate settings for the browser's
# that you wish to support.

# Please google "Disable CORS in browser" to find the appropriate settings for the browser's
# that you wish to support.
#
# This is a new property since Spring-Boot 2.4.0. Please consult the Spring documentation
# for usage.
# Defines the patterns to be used for CORS authentication.
